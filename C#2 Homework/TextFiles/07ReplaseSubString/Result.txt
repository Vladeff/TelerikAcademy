C#

C# language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
It is designed to balance power (C ++) with the possibility of rapid development (Visual Basic and Java).
Of the C # language on the .NET platform can be developed extremely diverse software, such as office 
applications, web applications, web sites, desktop applications, multimedia Internet applications, mobile 
applications, different types of games and many others.

Java

Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly, and manifestly typed, both 
are class-based object-oriented, both are designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, 
both use garbage-collection, and both are "curly brace languages".Programs written in Java, can run on many 
different computer architectures and operating systems unlike C #. Cons of the language is the high use of 
RAM and is also slow.

C

C is the oldest and most widely used language, providing the building blocks for other popular languages, 
such as C#, Java, JavaScript and PythonA programmer�s productivity under pure C is many times lower 
compared to their productivity under modern general-purpose programming languages like C#.

C++
Start
C++ is acceptable when you have to program applications that require very close work with the hardware 
or that have special performance requirements (like 3D games). For all other purposes (like web apps
development or business software) C++ is phenomenally inadequate. The C++ language lost its popularity 
mainly because of the inability to quickly write quality software with it. The productivity of C++ 
programmers is many times lower than C#�s.

PHP

With regards to programing languages popularity, besides C# and Java, another widely used language is PHP. 
It is suitable for developing small web sites and web applications, but it gives rise to serious difficulties 
when implementing large and complicated software systems. In the software industry PHP is used first and foremost 
for small projects, because it can easily lead developers into writing code that is bad, disorganized and hard to 
maintain, making it inconvenient for more substantial projects.

Python 

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.The language provides constructs intended
to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.Strengths Python are good readability and overall philosophy.
Cons of languages are despite the relatively easy-to-use libraries, they are poorly designed and written and have 
decent documentation.
